# Sales Prediction usin python
This project demonstrates how to predict product sales based on advertising spend across different media platforms using Linear Regression in  Python. It uses the Advertising dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning and marketing analytics, and explores how investments in TV, Radio, and Newspaper impact sales outcomes.

Objectives:

1. Load and explore advertising data.

2. Perform EDA (exploratory data analysis) using visualization.

3. Build and train a Linear Regression model.

4. Evaluate the model using RÂ², MAE, and MSE metrics.

5. Predict future sales based on hypothetical ad spend scenarios.
