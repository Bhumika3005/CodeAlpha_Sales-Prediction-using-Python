# Sales Prediction usin python
This project demonstrates how to predict product sales based on advertising spend across different media platforms using Linear Regression in  Python. It uses the Advertising dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning and marketing analytics, and explores how investments in TV, Radio, and Newspaper impact sales outcomes.
Objectives

Load and explore advertising data.

Perform EDA (exploratory data analysis) using visualization.

Build and train a Linear Regression model.

Evaluate the model using RÂ², MAE, and MSE metrics.

Predict future sales based on hypothetical ad spend scenarios.
